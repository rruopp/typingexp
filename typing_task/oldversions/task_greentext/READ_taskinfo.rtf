\f0\fs24 \cf0 This version of the task includes immediate feedback for each trial. As soon as the word is completed, the text will turn green if the word was typed correctly. It will stay white otherwise. Stimuli repeats are still possible within trial blocks and the hand-reset reminder is still text as opposed to an image in later versions.}
